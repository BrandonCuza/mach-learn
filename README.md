Copies of my projects for "Introduction to Machine Learning" with Dr. Karteek Popuri.

Assignment 1 concerns discriminating between patients with and without Alzheimer's Diseases based on glucose metabolism
rates of areas of the brain. Nearest Neighbour classification models were used.

Assignment 2 concerns determining the compression strength of concrete based on the ratios of its components. Ordinary least square,
Ridge, and Lasso regression models were used.

Assignment 3 again concerns discriminating between patients with and without Alzheimer's Disease based on glucose metabolism
rates of areas of the brain, however there are many more areas included in the data this time (i.e. the dimensionality of the data
is higher). SVMs with linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels were used.
